# Govee Lights Controll App

This is a web app to control my Govee brand home office light setup. Due to some limitations on Govee's API, I'll be only able to turn on/off the lights and change the brightness and the colors but it's enough for daily usage. I'll be deploying the APP when it's completed.

**_Note:_** Only the lights that have Wifi capabilities are supported by the Govee API, that's why only these lights will be visible on the app when the user sets their own API key and launches the app.
